Your constitution score increases by 1.
As a reaction upon taking damage, you may roll on the spore protection table.
You can do this a number of times equal to your constitution modifier (minimum of 1). You regain all spent uses on a long rest. 
Additionally, when you roll hit dice to regain hp, you recover 1 extra hp per die rolled.

| 1   | Heal back the damage you took from the triggering attack.                                                                                                                 |
| 2   | Your attacker must succeed on a strength saving throw or be trapped in spores. The spores have an AC of 10 and 5 HP.                                                      |
| 3   | Your attacker must succeed on a constitution saving throw or be poisoned, as a cloud of spores engulfs them. They can repeat this save at the end of each of their turns. |
| 4   | You teleport to a random spot within 60 feet.                                                                                                                             |
When any of these effects require a creature to make a saving throw, the save DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your constitution modifier.
