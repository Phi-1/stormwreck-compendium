If on their last turn before yours an ally missed an attack, you can pray to your god for a second chance. By foregoing one of your own attacks when you take the Attack action on your turn, you can use a bonus action to give that ally the chance to immediately use their reaction to make one weapon attack, adding your charisma bonus to the attack roll. You need to have seen your ally miss this attack to be able to use this feat.
If this attack hits, every ally that can see it gains a divine inspiration bonus randomly determined from the following table by the DM.

| d4  | Divine Inspiration Table                                                                                               |
| --- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Every ally gains temporary HP equal to your charisma modifier                                                          |
| 2   | Every ally has advantage on their attacks until the end of your next turn                                              |
| 3   | Every ally can deal 1d4 radiant damage when they hit with an attack until the end of your next turn                    |
| 4   | Every ally gains a bonus to their AC and saving throws equal to your charisma modifier until the end of your next turn |

After you use this feat to successfully land an attack once, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
