*(requires attunement by a Beastmaster in the presence of an animal companion)*

A small flute with three holes, made in the ancient woodland realm known as the Fayrwood.
If the animal companion you attuned to this item with dies, the attunement ends.

While attuned, you can use a bonus action to give your animal companion one of three special commands:
- Coordinated Attack: after you make an attack against a creature on this turn, your companion can use its reaction to dash up to 5 feet to your target and attack it as well. This movement doesn't provoke opportunity attacks.
- Distraction: your companion uses its reaction to distract a creature within 5 feet of it, giving you advantage on your next attack against it, or giving it disadvantage on a saving throw against an effect originating from you, whichever happens first. This distraction lasts until the start of your next turn.
- Cripple: if your companion hits a creature with an attack this turn, that creature's movement speed is reduced by 10 until the start of your next turn.

You can use this item a number of times per day equal to your proficiency bonus.
