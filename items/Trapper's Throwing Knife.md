*(requires attunement)*

This dagger gains a +1 to attack and damage rolls, and an additional +1 to attack rolls when thrown. 
After being thrown and hitting a creature, this dagger sticks in its target, decreasing the target's speed by 10 until removed.
As an action, the target can make a DC 13 constitution saving throw, pulling out the dagger on a success.
While within 5 feet of the dagger while it's stuck in a creature, the person attuned to this dagger can make an attack roll with advantage, dealing normal damage plus 1d6 necrotic damage on a hit, and magically pulling the dagger into their hand in the process.
